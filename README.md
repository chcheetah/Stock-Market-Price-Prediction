# Stock Market Price Prediction

A college project that uses data acquired from the Yahoo Finance API to predict 
the closing price of a stock in the National Stock Exchange, India. The main aim 
of the project is to compare the performance of traditional forecasting 
techniques for stock pricing with advanced AI based models,and determine their 
viability in real world scenarios.
